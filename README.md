# Notes-in-Mathematics

The repository hosts collections of results from courses taken during my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo, recommended textbooks, academic papers, and many other sources. I have been continuously building these notes since Fall 2025 and more than happy to take any critical feedback and/or constructive advice.
